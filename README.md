Project Name: Application Uptime Checker

Description:

This Python script is designed to check the uptime of web applications by sending HTTP GET requests and analyzing the status codes. It provides a simple and efficient way to monitor the availability of your applications.

Usage:
1:Install dependencies: Ensure you have the requests library installed:
Bash
pip install requests
2:Modify the URL: Replace "https://your-application-url.com" with the actual URL of the application you want to check.
3:Run the script: Execute the script using your Python interpreter.
Example:

Bash
python uptime_checker.py
Output:

The script will print the application's status: "up" if it's functioning correctly or "down" if it's unavailable or not responding.
Features:

Concurrent checks: The script can check multiple applications simultaneously using concurrent.futures.
Timeout: A configurable timeout can be set to prevent indefinite waiting.
Error handling: The script handles exceptions gracefully and provides informative error messages.
